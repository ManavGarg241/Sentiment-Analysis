Sentiment classification using pretrained BERT
Fine-tuning on a custom dataset (if applicable)
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Simple command-line interface or notebook-based interface

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Python
PyTorch / TensorFlow
Hugging Face Transformers
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
